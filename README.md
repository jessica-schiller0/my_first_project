# My First Project with Git and GitHub

This repository contains the data and analysis code for the project on the 
relationship between height and weight in the !Kung San.

## Getting started

### Installation

To run this code, you will need to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and 
the following R packages:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Executing the code

To run the code, clone this repository to your local machine and set your 
working directory to this repository. In the console, run:

```r
source("run.R")
```

The code will fit a regression model to the data and export a scatterplot of
heights and weights. The code should take no longer than a minute to run on a 
standard laptop.
